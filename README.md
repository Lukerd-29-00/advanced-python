# advanced-python
These are some Python tutorials for details your introductory classes probably won't cover, but are pretty important in actual Python development (and software in general).

## Prereqs
I'm assuming you have some programming experience, and know at least the basics of Python.

## Tools
I recommend that you use Visual Studio Code, but if you can make something else work, go ahead. Obviously, you will need to have python installed, ideally 3.10 or above. You can check your python version by going into a terminal and typing "python -v", and you can install it from <a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/>here</a>.
